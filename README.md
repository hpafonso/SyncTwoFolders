# SyncTwoFolders

## Description

This program will sync all contents of a source folder, to a new "replica" folder, with paths provided by the user. It also logs all of its actions (copy or delete) to a log file, which path will also be provided by the user.

The only thing missing from this program, is the synchronization interval.
